		<h1>Weekly Log Book - Thomas Abdallah</h1>
		<img src="images/thomas.jpg" alt="Image of Thomas" title="Handsome" />

		<h2>Week 1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked with Stan and David to develop project plan</li>
			<li>Developed CAN firmware for HCS12 microcontroller</li>
			<li>Debugged issues with CAN Rx ISR causing 'illegal bp' (unresolved)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Week2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Developed <a href= "https://github.com/eelmand/S6Project/blob/master/Project%20Plan/Elevator_CAN_Network.pdf">CAN network layout</a> and <a href= "https://github.com/eelmand/S6Project/blob/master/Project%20Plan/Shared_CAN_Protocol_Proposal.xlsx">protocol proposal</a> with Stan and David</li>
			<li>Reviewed proposal with class - agreed to all use same protocol and network layout at 125kBaud</li>
			<li>Fixed issues with CAN Rx ISR causing 'illegal bp'</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Was caused by initializing the timer module with overflow interrupts enabled, but forgot to include the interrupt handler in the project</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Implemented a FIFO library for storing Rx CAN messages</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Using dynamic memory allocation on the HCS12 (i.e. malloc) requires rebuilding the libraries with a sensible heap size</li>
				<li>Default heap size is 2000 bytes which is more than the available amount of RAM on our chip - this causes errors during linking</li>
				<li><a href= "https://community.nxp.com/thread/388977">Instructions for rebuilding the libraries</a></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Started implementing "Elevator Controller" module</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Using my own project board from Semester 4 as it already has a Scmitt trigger and a DAC</li>
				<li>Ultrasonic sensor implementation complete</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Using OC to send the 'trigger' pulse (10uS @20mS period) to the sensor</li>
					<li>Using IC to measure the 'echo' waveform pulse width</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Distance (cm) = Pulse Width (uS) / 58</li>
						<li>IC is messy without a Schmitt trigger to clean up the input signal</li>
						<li>Using the encoder input on my board as it already has this</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Using LCD to display the current distance measurement in cm</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Motor control implementation started</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Using SPI controlled DAC to send analog voltage to servo-amp</li>
					<li>Working on closed-loop control today (2017-05-19)</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>Week3</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Finished elevator controller implementation</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Using input-capture to measure ultrasonic sensor distance and convert to 'floor number'</li>
				<li>Using SPI controlled DAC to control motor voltage</li>
				<li>Closed loop (PI) controller implemented based on floor request</li>
				<li>Fully validated - code frozen and ready for entire class to use</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Installed PCAN Linux drivers</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href= "http://www.peak-system.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=256">This is not straight forward</a></li>
				<li>Drivers do not stay installed after rebooting Virtual Machine - okay for now</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Installed PCAN Basic API (Python and C++ support)</li>
			<li>Started playing with PCAN Basic API in Python to initialize and Tx/Rx messages</li>
			<li>Implemented a basic "SC" Python script that just sends commands to EC and prints out status stuff</li>
			<li><a href= "https://eelmand.github.io/S6Project/Website/about.html#sc_state_machine">Designed state machine for SC</a></li>
			<li>Implemented State Machine in Python - Supervisory Controller fully functional</li>
			<li>Worked with David to build 2 more floor controllers and set up a table for our CAN network testing</li>
			<li>Started testing complete CAN network (simulating Car Controller with USB to CAN device)</li>
